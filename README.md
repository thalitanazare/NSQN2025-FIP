## Repository Structure

- **QB_pitch_01.txt, QB_pitch_02.txt, QB_pitch_03.txt**  
  Pitch response data extracted from QBlade simulations under different environmental scenarios.

- **QB_wave_01.txt, QB_wave_02.txt, QB_wave_03.txt**  
  Wave excitation data files corresponding to distinct sea states.

- **QB_wind_01.txt, QB_wind_02.txt, QB_wind_03.txt**  
  Wind excitation data files for varying wind speeds and turbulence intensities.

- **tlpmit.1.txt**  
  Hydrodynamic radiationâ€“diffraction dataset generated by QBlade.  
  This file contains frequency-dependent added mass and radiation damping coefficients, as well as the hydrostatic restoring terms, arranged in a matrix form. These parameters are essential for describing the platformâ€™s dynamic response in the floating inverted pendulum formulation.

- **README.md**  
  Documentation file (this file).
